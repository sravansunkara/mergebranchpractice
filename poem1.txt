The Skylark

Aloft in the azure, cloudless sky,
The skylark sings his blithesome lay;
And, as he soars, his notes more high,
More sweet, more clear, they float away.

No resting-place he seems to know,
No pause his joyous song to stay;
But, like a spirit, on he goes,
And sings his song of joy alway.

Afar he soars, till he is lost
In the blue depths of heaven above;
But still his song of joy is tossed
Back to us on the wings of love.

And thus, through life, our souls should rise
Above the cares and sorrows here;
And, like the skylark, ever rise
To sing our songs of joy more clear.

No resting-place we here should know,
No pause our onward course to stay;
But, like the skylark, ever go
Onward and upward, day by day.

And thus, when life's short day is done,
And we have reached our heavenly home,
We may, like him, our songs of joy
Sing on forever, free from care and roam.
